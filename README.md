# VRG_code
The software_operation.txt is used to describe the specific steps of the three pipelines to get mutations, respectively.


RTG can get de novo mutations through the steps in the above file, but for the other two pipelines namely VarScan and GATK, 
extractDENOVO.py and extract_hilo_DENOVO.py are needed, respectively.


The delete_OvM.py file is used to simplify subsequent comparative analysis.


We used three metrics namely GC content, substitution type and SNV density, to evaluate the differences in the calling results 
generated by three pipelines.
The GC1_calculate.py, GC2_combine.py, and GC3_count.py are used to get GC content, together.
The judgeType.py is applied to get substitution type including the point mutations of transition and transversion.
The countPOS.py is employed to get SNV density.


For three pipelines, read coverage are got by coverageCount_VARSCAN.py, coverageCount_RTG.py, coverageCount_GATK.py, respectively.
